# Install On Ubuntu

Install `zsh`, using the script below, then you need to _reboot_. Apologies!

````shell
sudo sh ./ubuntu/zsh.sh
````

After boot, install everything else.

```shell
sudo zsh ./ubuntu.zsh
```

### Customization

- Anything placed in `~/.zshrc.user` will run on every shell instance
- You can open that file using the `dotconfig` alias
- Open `~/.zshrc` file with the `zshconfig` alias.
- I won't install Sublime Text packages for you. You do that. _You did get [`Package Control`][3], though._ Recommended packages in [FEATURES][1] document.
- Want to customize this even further? **Fork this repository!**
